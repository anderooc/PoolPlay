                Provide accurate account information, keep your credentials

              </h2>
              <p>
                Tournament organizers control event details, eligibility,
                registration decisions, schedules, scores, communications,
                waiver settings, and payment instructions. Organizers are
                responsible for the accuracy of that information, obtaining any
                required participant consent, and complying with rules and laws
                that apply to their event.

                Payments and waivers

              <p>
                PoolPlay records payment status but does not process or hold
                funds. Payment disputes remain between organizers and teams.
                Digital acknowledgments and uploaded waiver documents are tools
                for organizers; PoolPlay does not determine whether a waiver is
                legally sufficient or enforceable.

                PoolPlay permission to store, process, display, and send it as
                needed to operate the service. Public event information may be
                visible without an account. If an account is deleted, historical
                schedules and results may remain with the organizer identity
                anonymized.

                The service is provided as available and can experience errors,
                delays, or interruptions. Verify safety-critical and game-day
                information through the organizer when necessary. Access may be
                limited or removed for security, abuse, legal compliance, or
                material violations of these terms.
